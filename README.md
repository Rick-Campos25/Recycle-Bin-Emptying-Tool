This Python project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for emptying the Recycle Bin on a Windows system. With the click of a button, the application clears the Recycle Bin and gives visual feedback through success or error message popups.

Language Used:
Python

Libraries Used:
- tkinter (for creating the GUI interface)
- tkinter.messagebox (for displaying pop-up messages)
- winshell (for interacting with the Windows Recycle Bin)

Note:
- This tool is specifically designed for Windows systems.
- The `winshell` library must be installed for this application to work (`pip install winshell`).
